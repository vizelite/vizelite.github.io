# VizWrestling combines two things I really enjoy: professional wrestling and data analytics.

### Visualizing The Elite

The motivation behind this project is to utilize match data to provide an overview of things like how your favorite wrestlers are performing in terms of wins and losses, how often wrestlers are used on specific programs, and how wrestlers are being featured in in-ring competitions. The interactive dashboards can be used to enable users to explore the rankings and statistics among wrestlers. The analytical platform can be used to assist in developing storylines among wrestlers.

Version 1.0 was released on Friday, Feb 28th, in preparation for the AEW Revolution Pay Per View event, which was held on Saturday, Feb 29th in Chicago, Illinois. It provided a data-centric analysis of AEW matches leading up to the event along with some interesting statistics and findings from AEW history. The archived page can be found here.

### AEW Dynamite Twitter Activity Report

The motivation behind this project is to capture user activity on Twitter during a major television broadcast and observe how well the program is resonating with their audience. The analysis can identify popular topics and hashtags, locate key users, and provide additional insights on how content is being shared.

I applied this to AEW Dynamite which airs on TNT every Wednesday at 7pm CST for its 2 hour broadcast of wrestling matches and promos. The latest episode, on Wednesday, March 18th, 2020, was especially interesting for several reasons – from anticipated reveals to having it broadcast with no live audience due to the Coronavirus pandemic.

### AEW Twitter Activity Interactive Dashboard

This interactive demo contains a subset of the total dataset (9,466 tweets) covering the last ten minutes of the show and five minutes after it ends (8:50pm-9:05pm CST). (Sorry, If this doesn’t load, I might have maxed out my Heroku resources. Please try again later.)
